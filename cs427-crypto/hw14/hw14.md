## Question 1

> Alice and Bob are going to perform three instances of Diffie-Hellman key agreement. The protocol says that each time
> they should choose $a, b$ exponents randomly. Unfortunately, the programmer that they hired was asleep during the DHKA
> lecture in CS427, and provided a stupid implementation of DHKA. Instead of random exponents, they use sequential
> exponents. That is, Alice & Bob use random exponents $a, b$ in the first DHKA, then $a+1, b+1$ in the second, $a+2,
> b+2$ in the third.
>
> Eve observes all of these DHKA interactions as an eavesdropper. She later learns the key derived
> from the second DHKA instance. Describe how she can now compute the first and third DHKA keys.
