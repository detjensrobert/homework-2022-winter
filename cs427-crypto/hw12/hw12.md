## Question 1

> Suppose Enc-then-MAC+AD is instantiated with CBC mode and any secure MAC, as described in the text. The scheme is secure for fixed-length associated data. Show that if variable-length associated data is allowed, then the scheme does not provide AEAD security.

> *Note: you are not attacking the MAC! Take advantage of the fact that $d||c$ is ambiguous when the length of $d$ is not fixed and publicly known.*

> For reference: this question is referring to the AEAD security (definition 15.2 in the book) of this scheme:

\begin{center}
\framebox{
  \codebox{
    \underline{$\subname{Enc}((k_e, k_m), d, m_1 || ... || m_l)$:} \\
    \> $c_0 \gets \bits^\lambda$ \\
    \> for $i=1$ to $l$ \\
    \> \> $c_i := F(k_e, c_{i-1} \oplus m_i)$ \\
    \> $t := M.\MAC(k_m, d||c_0||c_1|| ... ||c_l)$ \\
    \> return $(c_0, c_1, ..., c_l, t)$
  }
  \qquad
  \codebox{
    \underline{$\subname{Dec}((k_e, k_m), d, (c_0, ... , c_l, t))$:} \\
    \> if $t \neq M.\MAC(k_m, d||c_0||c_1||...||c_l)$ \\
    \> \> return \err \\
    \> for $i=1$ to $l$ \\
    \> \> $m_i := F^{-1}(k_e, c_{i}) \oplus c_{i-1}$ \\
    \> return $m_1 || ... || m_l$
  }
}
\end{center}

> The set of associated data signifiers is $\mc D = \bits^*$

Consider an attacking library $\A$ linked against two libraries $\lib{aead\$-real}$ and $\lib{aead\$-rand}$:

\begin{center}
\titlecodebox{$\A$}{
  $d, x, m \gets \bits^\lambda$ \\
  $c := \subname{ctxt}(d, x||m)$ \\
  $m' := \subname{decrypt}(d||x, c)$ \\
  return $m \? m'$
}
\qquad
\titlecodebox{$\lib{aead\$-real}^\Sigma$}{
  $k_E, k_M \gets \Sigma.\KeyGen$ \\
  $\Seen := \emptyset$ \\
  \\
  \underline{$\subname{ctxt}(d \in \D, m \in \Sigma.\M)$} \\
  \> $c_0 \gets \bits^\lambda$ \\
  \> for $i=1$ to $l$: \\
  \> \> $c_i := F(k_e, c_{i-1} \oplus m_i)$ \\
  \> $t := \MAC(k_m, d||c_0||c_1|| ... ||c_l)$ \\
  \> $\Seen := \Seen \cup \{ (d, c_0, ... , c_l, t) \}$ \\
  \> return $(c_0, c_1, ... , c_l, t)$ \\
  \\
  \underline{$\subname{decrypt}(d \in \D, c \in \Sigma.\C)$} \\
  \> if $(d, c) \in \Seen$: return \err \\
  \> if $t \neq \MAC(k_m, d||c_0||c_1||...||c_l)$: \\
  \> \> return \err \\
  \> for $i=1$ to $l$: \\
  \> \> $m_i := F^{-1}(k_e, c_{i}) \oplus c_{i-1}$ \\
  \> return $m_1 || ... || m_l$
}
\qquad
\titlecodebox{$\lib{aead\$-rand}^\Sigma$}{
  $k_M \gets \Sigma.\KeyGen$ \\
  \\
  \underline{$\subname{ctxt}(d \in \D, m \in \Sigma.\M)$} \\
  \> $c \gets \Sigma.\C(|m|)$ \\
  \> $t := \MAC(k_M, c)$ \\
  \> return $(c, t)$ \\
  \\
  \underline{$\subname{decrypt}(d \in \D, c \in \Sigma.\C)$} \\
  \> return \err
}
\end{center}

As the construction of this scheme is ambiguous in combining $d$ and $m$, merely appending them together, this allows an attacker to construct two different message-data pairs that encrypt/decrypt to the same text. This allows the attacking library $\A$ to encrypt a message $x||m$ with associated data $d$ that will also successfully decrypt for a different associated data $d||x$. As the MAC ambiguously appends the message and data, this middle block $x$ can be specified in either the end of the data or start of the message and behave identically for both.

As the library was only asked to encrypt the message $x||m$ with data $d$, a decryption request for message $m$ with data $d||x$ is allowed, and also decrypts successfully to the original input $m$. The rand library will always return \err regardless of input. This discrepancy allows the attacking library $\A$ to differentiate between the two libraries:

\begin{align*}
  Pr[\A \link \lib{aead\$-real} \implies true] &= 1 \\
  Pr[\A \link \lib{aead\$-rand} \implies true] &= 0 \\
  \text{Advantage: } 1
\end{align*}

Thus, $\A$ has a non-negligible advantage and this scheme does not provide AEAD security.

## Question 2

> Show that if you know the salt $s$ of the Poly-UHF construction, you can efficiently find a collision.

The polynomial for Poly-UHF is defined as:

$$
s^d + x_{d-1}s^{d-1} ... + x_1 s + x_0
$$

Thus, if the salt $s$ is known, an attacker can distribute one of the $s$ multiplications to the second term ($x_1 + 1$) from the last term ($x_0 - s$). This new polynomial will evaluate to the same result for all $s$ and $x$ as this is in the $\Z_p$ space, and in the case that either modification overflows p, the mod-$p$ nature of the evaluation will still result in the expected result.

$$
UHF(... || x_1 || x_0) == UHF(... || x_0+1 || x_1-s)
$$

As the hash result for both of these polynomials (and thus both inputs) results in the same output, this is a hash collision.

## Question 3

> Show that if you are allowed to see only the output of Poly-UHF (i.e., the salt remains hidden), on chosen inputs then you can compute the salt.

For a 1-block Poly-UHF, the Horner's Rule evaluation for salt $s$ and message $x$ is $s + x$. Thus, for a block length of $\lambda$, performing the Poly-UHF of $\zerol$ will result in $s + 0 = s$.
