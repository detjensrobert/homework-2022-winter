  Sorry, hard drive died. Found an old one in the closet but had to reinstall
  everything--it was completely blank.

  What are you doing up so early?

  You know me. Early bird and all that.

  Hey, it's about time for bonuses. Let me know how much you think you'll need.
  Pretty sure you've earned one this year.

  Canada is all taken care of, although we'll need to make a trip there soon.
  I'll fill you in later.

  All that remains is my trip south of the equator. Will cost about $200k for
  the both of us. You can judge how much a bonus would be suspicious--be nice
  to make a down payment on the property.

  We're all ready to go now. One more for you, but I don't want to send that in
  the clear--probably being paranoid.

  Remember when we took CS373 together--the way we started sharing things after
  that lab? Yeah. Next time.

  Glad to be back--I missed you.

  Guess what was in the mail when I got home?

  <3

  I really love that picture of us at that little dive bar by the Baths. That'll
  be us everyday soon.

  Ha--that's all real!

  Found that someone isn't very careful with their coding. A little SQL
  injection and, viola, 2 birth records added. From there it was just a matter
  of ordering a copy of our birth certificates.

  Once I was up there, it was easy to get the passports. The nice lady made an
  exception for you being present, given that we'd been away on a mission with
  our parents for the last several years and you wanted to get home so bad for
  our wedding.

  Still open for a trip to Vancouver on Saturday?

  Well, aren't you the clever one. I knew there was a reason I fell in love with
  you all over again.

  Can't say that I'm all that thrilled about getting married again so soon. I
  guess it is worth it if you think it will help. Don't islanders like to live
  in sin these days?

  We're going to have to be more careful at work. I don't know if people have
  noticed us yet, but we are spending a lot more time together and we can't keep
  using the new building as an excuse.

  Ok, I'm heading out. I'm flying into to Vancouver, will pick up the car and
  drive down so our registration will match our passports as we cross the
  border. I'll meet you at that Indian restaurant in Redmond at 11ish.

  We're scheduled at the Commissioner at 4, so should be plenty of time.

  It'll make it much easier--and we'll save $180k this way.

  All I can say is about damn time. Should've never let Jack talk us into going
  IPO.

  Have to say you cleaned up pretty nice, and that celebrant was a hoot. Sorry
  you had to drive back up from Redmond, but understand things need to add up.
  When do you head out?

  It was actually a really nice time, wasn't it. Be good when we can finally be
  together, Ms. McCrae.

  Well, Jack got what he deserved. That ass.

  Sunday night--everyone on the team thinks I'm sailing in Baja.  I arrive at
  VLI at noon on Tuesday--have to go through Sydney, and only one flight a day,
  so a bit of a layover.

  I'm going to move this server to AWS this weekend--we shouldn't use it when it
  is up there. Our Palo Alto will throw an alert on traffic from domains that
  have recently changed, and I don't want anyone looking into it.

  Oh, got the accounts set up. I'll send you the info. Thank god for bitcoin.

  I can't wait to get back to the tropics. So much fun.

  We did pretty good with bitcoin. . .made a few quid by the time everything
  went through.

  As soon as it hits GD it will be moved.

  See you tomorrow

  Money has been moved. You know the plan. Text me as soon as you get this, so I
  can delete the server and throw this system away--I have to move fast if I'm
  going to make my flight after driving from Astoria.

  If for some reason we can't connect in Mexico City, keep going--I'll meet you
  there. Malvanua. -15.359212, 167.193547. We own the whole thing, so stay in
  the big house. :)

  Print these out, then throw your laptop in the river.

  We should be there before anyone notices anything wrong.
