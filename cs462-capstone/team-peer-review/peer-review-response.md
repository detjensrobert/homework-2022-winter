# CS 462 Peer Review

## Robert Detjens

## Feedback

Reviews from the team are appended at the end of this document.

## Response

This feedback is all positive and is representative of the work I have done on this project. I have made a successful
effort to be present for all team meetings and encourage the other members of the group. I had been the main lead in
making sure we have all of our components done on time, and prodding others to get their parts finished and up to
quality.

## Goals

My goals for next term are the following:

- Ensure that the build daemon component that I am responsible for works correctly with the rest of the system and that
  all the other components are interacting well with it.
- Ensure that the interface to the daemon via the command-line script is user-friendly and documented well.
- Work with Nathan to improve what options are exposed to the user on the deployment website frontend and what can be
  left as default.
